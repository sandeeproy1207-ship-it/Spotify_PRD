# 🎧 Spotify Project — PRD Case Study

This repository contains a Product Requirements Document (PRD) proposing an AI-powered playlist generation feature for Spotify to reduce "paradox of choice" during music discovery.

## 📌 Problem Summary
Users often feel overwhelmed by too many playlist options, leading to repetitive listening patterns and lower discovery rates. Research indicated that decision fatigue limits exploration, especially when users are unsure what to play.

## 🎯 Proposed Solution — *Prompt Harmony*
An AI-driven playlist experience that:
- Generates playlists based on **user intent** (mood, task, context, prompt input)
- Uses **behavioral + listening data** to personalize results
- Reduces search effort and increases discovery

## 📊 Key Deliverables
- User research + segmentation
- RICE-based prioritization
- User journeys + interaction flows
- Metrics & success criteria (retention, skip rate, completion rate)
- Rollout plan + risks
